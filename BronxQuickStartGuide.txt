BACKGROUND: Yesterday was an exciting day in the Bronx. The consumer tech company Damnsung was launching a new high-performance all-in-one stereo system, the Blaster 3000 Boombox, and New York's underground music scene would be the first to experience it. The 6:00 news showed hundreds of people queuing up at Damnsung stores in the Bronx and all around New York City, all clearly prepared to stay the night. You, on the other hand, simply muted the TV at home and popped in your favorite mixtape – Beethoven's 4th. 
This morning, you woke with a start. Your buddy Tyrone had smashed through the front door, and lunged towards you. Fortunately you had a detached pipe from kitchen sink repairs handy.
As you scratched your head over the twitching corpse of your former friend, you suddenly became aware of sounds outside. Sounds of glass breaking, people yelling, and very loud rap music. You decided to check things out on the outside. Moving with a low profile, you witness a riot unlike any other – thugs, gangsters, and criminals rushing in coordinated groups with students, working men, and single moms to beat down random individuals  – what was going on here? You also saw scores of Blaster 3000s in the windowsills and on street curbs – that's when it hit you. They were all playing the same station. The Blaster 3000s were the cause of the riot.
You spent the rest of the day fighting, fleeing, and gathering other unaffected individuals like yourself. Funny, they all seem to be fans of classical music, too. 
By the end of the day, you and your new friends have gathered weapons and supplies from various looted stores. Tomorrow morning, your ragtag group of survivors plan to destroy all the Blaster 3000s in the Bronx.





GAME STRUCTURE:
Each round begins with a pre-round, before the rioters have woken up. During the pre-round, you can scavenge for better weapons and armor scattered around the map. At the end of the pre-round, the riot will start and you and your teammates will be respawned. You will then have about 10 minutes to find and destroy all the Blaster 3000 boomboxes in the area (the number of boomboxes changes with the number of players). Blaster 3000s will ALWAYS be found inside buildings, so make sure to check every room. Supplies will continue to spawn during the riot, and the most supplies are often located on the rooftops of the riskiest buildings. Killed players cannot respawn. If time runs out before all players die, the game will automatically be lost and you will become overrun with rioters. 

GUN MECHANICS:
Gunplay is very similar to the Left 4 Dead series. You have 3 slots for weapons – your primary weapon, your secondary weapon, and one grenade or deployable device. To switch your current weapon with one on the ground, drop it with "Q" (Default). 
Sustained automatic fire will make bullets start to shoot above your crosshair, CS-style. This means you'll have to start aiming downwards to compensate for recoil.
Some guns suffer more from continuous fire than others. For example, the MA41 has high recoil when spraying, whereas the Mack 11 has a little. Pistols have barely any.

You can perform a gun butt attack with the secondary fire key. This will Stun Rioters long enough for you to shoot them. One thing to be aware of is that after a melee attack, you'll be able to shoot sooner than you'll be able to melee again. You can also melee while reloading, which can buy you enough time to finish.
Melee weapons take up your secondary weapon slot. They can be swung even while sprinting.

Below is the current list of weapon and a description:



//PISTOLS
Glok-17
The standard-issue pistol for most police forces and gangsters around the US. This one is rather illegal because the dead cop you picked it off of was using a 17-round magazine. Doesn't he know that New York bans the sale and usage of magazines over 7 rounds?

Deserted Eagle AE
A bigger pistol than the Glok with a more-legal 8 round magazine. It's slow to fire, but each shot can take down a Tyrone in one hit, so it's crucial to make each bullet count.

//SMGs
Mack-11
This is Piru 187, put a Slob on his back with a Mack-11, A Kelly with a gun won't run and hide, it's a nigga Crip Inch and comin' from the East Side.
This SMG fires lightning quick, but eats ammo fast. Be careful if you're using a pistol with this weapon as overuse might leave you defenseless.

//Shotguns
CAWS 870
The Close Assault Weapon System model 870 is a compact and deadly shotgun, with a built-in choke that spreads out pellets for a wider range of effect. This choke, however, causes midrange shots to suffer.

//Rifles
MA41
An accurate rifle that can fire full-auto if needed. Closely related to the Baby-killing, hate-mongering asphalt rifle SprayArggggh15.

Spray-K 47
A classic, powerful rifle of Russian blood. Slower to fire than the MA41 but stronger.

//Melee
JM Eagle P.G.I.W.
The JM Eagle P.lumber's G.eneral I.ssue W.eapon is a powerful close-in defense weapon. This can knock a rioter's lights out in one swing, but make sure you time your swings well, as this pipe is pretty darn heavy for a non-Plumber like yourself.

Baton
A must-have tool in any riot situation, police batons have been in use to control rioters and aggressive individuals for almost a century. It is very quick to swing and a one-two knock to the head will dispatch any rioter. Skilled users can combine the weapon's speed with the secondary push attack for some sick combos.

//Equipment
Watermelon Pipe Bomb
Need to make a quick escape? Give that rioter a watermelon. Rioters LOVE watermelon.
